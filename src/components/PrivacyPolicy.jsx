              <li><strong>Where we need to perform the contract</strong> we are about to enter into or have entered into with you. This means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</li>
              <li><strong>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests</strong> (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. This means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.

              <li><strong>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</strong> This means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mt-6">
              Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third-party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message.

Please see the table below to understand the lawful basis that we will rely on to process your personal data in various circumstances.

            <p>
              We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
            </p>
            <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-1">
              <li>requested information from us;</li>
              <li>purchased products or services from us;</li>
              <li>provided us with your details when you attended an event, conference, trade show;</li>
              <li>provided us with your details when you registered for an event, competition, or promotion;</li>
              <li>provided us with your details for any other reason;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">THIRD-PARTY MARKETING</h3>
            <p>
              We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the group of companies for marketing purposes.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">OPTING OUT</h3>
            <p>
              You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at{' '}

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">CHANGE OF PURPOSE</h3>
            <p>
              We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
            <p>
              We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.
            </p>
            
            <div className="space-y-4 mt-6">
              <div>
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Internal Third Parties:</h4>
                <p>Other companies in the Metapack Group acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in any of our offices in Poland, Germany, the Netherlands or the USA.</p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li>Service providers, acting as processors, who may be based within or outside the EEA, who provide IT, software-as-a-service (SaaS), system administration and other services which support the functions of our business.</li>
                  <li>Professional advisers, acting as processors or joint controllers, including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in who may be based within or outside the EEA, who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, accounting and similar professional services.</li>
                  <li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li>
                  <li>Tax authorities, regulators, public bodies or other parties, acting as joint controllers or processors, based in countries where Metapack carries on business operations and where disclosure is required in accordance with applicable law.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p className="mt-6">
              We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">6. International transfers</h2>
            <p>
              We share your personal data within the Metapack Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
              <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission or the UK government. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</li>
              <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission or the UK Information Commissioner's Office which give personal data the same protection it has in UK and the EEA. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries or the UK Information Commissioner Office's International data transfer agreement and guidance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">7. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
              We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, altered, disclosed or used in an unauthorised way. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions (where we are the data controller) or on the data controller's instructions (where we are the data processor) and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">8. Data retention</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</h3>
            <p>
              We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Details of the retention periods for different categories of personal data are set out in our Data Retention Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data. See Your Legal Rights below for further information.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">9. Your legal rights</h2>
            <p>
              Where we are the data controller, and under certain circumstances, you have the following rights in relation to your personal data:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-6 space-y-4">
              <li><strong>The right to request access to your personal data</strong> (a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
              <li><strong>The right to request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</strong> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
              <li><strong>The right to request erasure of your personal data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
              <li><strong>The right to object to the processing of your personal data</strong> where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
              <li><strong>The right to request restriction of processing of your personal data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
              <li><strong>The right to request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.</strong> We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
              <li><strong>The right to withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mt-6">
              To exercise any of the rights set out above, please refer to our Data Subject Request Process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we are a data processor, you should make your request directly to the data controller.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</h3>
            <p>
              You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h3>
            <p>
              We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</h3>
            <p>
              We try to respond to all legitimate requests (where we are the data controller) within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
